# BCFtools Python Wrapper for Rare Variant Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that identifies rare variants in a VCF file using BCFtools. The script processes VCF files to find variants with a gnomAD population allele frequency of less than 0.01.

## Files structure
- script.py: Main Python script for variant analysis
- NA12878.chr21.slice.vcf.gz: Input sample VCF file
- gnomad.chr21.slice.vcf.gz: Reference gnomAD VCF file with population frequencies
  - Generated files:
    - NA12878.chr21.slice.norm.vcf.gz: Normalized VCF
    - NA12878.chr21.slice.annotated.vcf.gz: Annotated VCF with gnomAD frequencies
    - NA12878.chr21.slice.filtered.vcf.gz: Filtered VCF containing rare variants
    - rare_variants_with_AF.txt: Output file listing rare variants with their frequencies
    - filtered_stats.txt: Statistical analysis of filtered variants

## Dependencies
Python 3.x 

BCFtools

## Pipeline Steps
1. Normalization: Splits multi-allelic sites into separate records
2. Indexing: Creates indices for VCF files
3. Annotation: Adds gnomAD allele frequencies to the sample VCF
4. Filtering: Identifies variants with AF < 0.01
5. Analysis: Counts and lists rare variants
6. Statistics: Creates detailed variant statistics

## Output
The script generates:
- A filtered VCF file (*.filtered.vcf.gz) containing rare variants
- A text file (rare_variants_with_AF.txt) listing:
    - Chromosome
    - Position
    - Reference allele
    - Alternative allele
    - Allele frequency
- A statistical analysis text file (filtered_stats.txt) showing:
    - Total variants: 9
    - Variant types: 6 SNPs, 3 indels
    - Quality metrics ranging from 21 to 53
    - Depth distribution from 2 to 22 reads
 
## Vizualization

Using bcftools stats output, we can visualize the substitution patterns with matplotlib  :

As an example, substitution plot is shown here that is generated by plot-vcfstats, the command line was:
- `plot-vcfstats -p vcfstats_plots -t svg --title Filtered VCF Statistics filtered_stats.txt`

  - Substitution Pattern Analysis
Bar plot shows the distribution of single nucleotide substitutions

  - Reveals:
    - A>T substitutions are most frequent (2 occurrences)
    - Single occurrences of C>T, G>A, G>T, and T>C substitutions
    - No instances of other possible substitutions (A>C, A>G, C>A, C>G, G>C, T>A, T>G)
